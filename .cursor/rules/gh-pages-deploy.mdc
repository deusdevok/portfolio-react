# GitHub Pages Deployment Guide

This rule provides information on deploying this React application to GitHub Pages.

## Prerequisites
- Your homepage is set to: https://deusdevok.github.io/portfolio-react
- You have GitHub Actions workflow setup in .github/workflows/deploy.yml

## Deployment Process
1. Make your changes to the codebase
2. Commit and push your changes to the master branch
3. GitHub Actions will automatically:
   - Build your project with `npm run build`
   - Deploy to GitHub Pages using the peaceiris/actions-gh-pages action

## Manual Deployment (if needed)
```bash
# Install dependencies if needed
npm install

# Build the project
npm run build

# Deploy to GitHub Pages (requires gh-pages package)
npm install --save-dev gh-pages
npx gh-pages -d build
```

## Troubleshooting
- Check GitHub Actions tab in your repository for build/deployment errors
- Ensure your repository has proper permissions for GitHub Actions
- Verify your homepage is correctly set in package.json
